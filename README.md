# Reverse Polish notation (RPN)

>_Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), which puts the operator before its operands. It is also known as postfix notation. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description "Polish" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented (prefix) Polish notation in the 1920s._

# Example code
```
10 x =
0 a =
1 b =

start :

1 x - x =
a temp =
b a =
temp b + b =

a PRINTLN

start x JNZ

Finished_The_Task! PRINTLN
Result:__ PRINT
a PRINTLN
```

This code example will calculate the 10th fibonacci number. Output:

```
